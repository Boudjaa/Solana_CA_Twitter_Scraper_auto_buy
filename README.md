# Solana_CA_Twitter_Scraper_auto_buy
This Python script continuously monitors a specific Twitter account for the latest tweet. If it detects an SPL token CA, it will automatically send this information to your preferred Telegram sniper bot Ex. (Trojan, Maestro SolTradingBot, Bonkbot). Your sniper bot should already be configured to buy upon receiving any SPL token contract address.
